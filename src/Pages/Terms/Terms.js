                            and/or answers in surveys conducted by the Panel or Partners, the Administrator has the
                            right to deny such member in the Panel membership and has the right to revoke and withhold
                            all rewards previously and currently accrued.</p>

                            (six) consecutive months, the Administrator has the right to unilaterally terminate such
                            member's membership, including by deleting the account created by the Respondent and
